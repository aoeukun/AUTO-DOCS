# Welcome to the **Automatic Code Documentation Project** 🚀

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Automatic Code Documentation Project**, where we automate the generation of documentation for Python code using **Gemini API** and **MkDocs**. This project ensures that your code is always well-documented, up-to-date, and easy to understand.

## 🧑‍💻 Features

### ✨ **Automated Code Documentation**
- Automatically generates detailed documentation for your Python code using the **Gemini API**.
- Easily integrates into your GitHub repository via **GitHub Actions**.
- Every change to your code results in updated documentation—no manual work required!

### 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**
- Documentation is regenerated and updated every time you push new code to the repository.
- Automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** for seamless access.

### 🌍 **GitHub Pages Deployment**
- View your project documentation live via GitHub Pages at any time.
- Always up-to-date, accessible from anywhere.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Push Code:**  
   Whenever you push changes to the `main` branch, the workflow automatically triggers.

2. **Generate Documentation:**  
   The system uses the **Gemini API** to analyze and generate detailed, human-readable documentation.

3. **Deploy the Site:**  
   All documentation is then deployed to **GitHub Pages**, making it instantly available.

     cd <your-repo-name>
     ```
   - Install the required Python dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

### 3. Generate Documentation Locally:
   - Generate the documentation for the code by running the script:
     ```bash
     python generate_docs.py
     ```

### 4. Serve the Documentation Locally:
   - Serve the MkDocs site locally to view the generated documentation:
