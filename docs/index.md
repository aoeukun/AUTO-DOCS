# Welcome to the **Automatic Code Documentation Project** 🚀

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Automatic Code Documentation Project**, where we automate the generation of documentation for Python code using **Gemini API** and **MkDocs**. This project ensures that your code is always well-documented, up-to-date, and easy to understand.

### 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**
- Documentation is regenerated and updated every time you push new code to the repository.
- Automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** for seamless access.

### 🌍 **GitHub Pages Deployment**

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Push Code:**  
   Whenever you push changes to the `main` branch, the workflow automatically triggers.

2. **Generate Documentation:**  
   The system uses the **Gemini API** to analyze and generate detailed, human-readable documentation.

3. **Deploy the Site:**  
   All documentation is then deployed to **GitHub Pages**, making it instantly available.
