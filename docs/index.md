#  Automatic Code Documentation 🚀

Welcome to **Auto Code Docs** — where your code meets intelligence.

Imagine a world where your Python codebase *documents itself* — beautifully, intelligently, and automatically. That's what we built. Sit back and let AI do the heavy lifting while you focus on creating brilliant software.

## ✨ Why This Project?

<br>
  **"90% Of developers hate writing docs. The other 10% are lying." – Every Developer Ever**

<br>
Writing documentation is tedious. But it's essential for collaboration, onboarding, and maintaining high-quality software. So we asked:

> **What if your code could explain itself?**

This project answers that with a seamless pipeline that **analyzes your code using an LLM**, extracts meaningful descriptions, and turns it all into a **fully-deployed website** — without you writing a single docstring.

  Uses Gemini-Api to analyze your code and generate intelligent documentation.

- 🛠️ **Seamless Automation**  
  Set it and forget it — every push to GitHub triggers automatic doc generation and deployment.

- 📚 **Beautiful MkDocs Site**  
  Clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. Built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and deployed with GitHub Pages.

- 🚀 **Lightning-Fast Setup**  
  Drop in your code,push to github, and you’re done. It's that easy.

## 🔄 **Real-Time Updates**
- Documentation is regenerated and updated every time you push new code to the repository.
- Automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** for seamless access.

---

## 🌍 **GitHub Pages Deployment**
- View your project documentation live via GitHub Pages at any time.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Push Code:**  
   Whenever you push changes to the `main` branch, the workflow automatically triggers.

2. **Generate Documentation:**  
   The system uses the **Gemini API** to analyze and generate detailed, human-readable documentation.

3. **Markdown Generation**  
   The documentation is converted into `.md` files stored under `docs/generated/`.


4. **Deploy the Site:**  
   All documentation is then deployed to **GitHub Pages**, making it instantly available.
